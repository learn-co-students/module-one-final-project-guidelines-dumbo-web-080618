# SOLE SEARCH

Congratulations, you've just got yourself a copy of SOLE SEARCH! You've gotta be the luckiest guy in the sneaker game today.

SOLE SEARCH is NYC's hottest new sneaker finder. Slap some heat on those bare feet by finding some real rare pairs at stores around town. Whether you need a pair for the toe or a pair to flip and make some cash, SOLE SEARCH is here for you.

Oh wait, you're a store owner? We got you covered too! Create that profile so all those little Hypebeasts can find out what product you have. Don't let the good stuff sit on your shelves, put your stock in and watch kids riot out front your store tryna cop a pair...

Let's tell you how to use this gold mine of a program. Follow these instructions so you don't look like a chump.

## Installation

1. Download the folder that contains ALL the files (Oh SNAP! You already did this. Look at you, already killin the game.)
2. Go into that terminal like you're about to HACK THE PLANET and get into the folder for this app.
3. Run that bundle install by typing "bundle install"
4. If you wanna have all this sweet sweet data that's in this app, you gotta migrate and seed, bro. Run "rake db:migrate" and watch that magic happen.
5. Next type in "rake db:seed" and get that data, son.
6. Finally, type in "ruby bin/run.rb" and watch Johnny 5 come alive.
7. Have fun my sneaker dudes and dudettes!

BONUS -- See if you can find all the GIFs that are hidden throughout the program...
